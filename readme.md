# 🧠 Next Word Prediction Using LSTM

A simple Streamlit web app that predicts the next word in a sentence using an LSTM-based language model trained on Shakespeare's *Hamlet*.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) — specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model — for word-level next-word prediction. The model is trained on the classic literary text *Hamlet* by William Shakespeare.

The final model is deployed as an interactive web application using **Streamlit**, where users can enter a sentence and receive a predicted next word in real time.
